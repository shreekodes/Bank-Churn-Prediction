# Bank Churn Prediction with XGBoost & Streamlit 

Predicting whether a customer will leave a bank before they even do.  
This project showcases a **production-ready ML pipeline** built to solve a real-world business problem using **XGBoost**, **SMOTE**, and **Streamlit**.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement  
Banks lose millions every year due to customer churn.  
This project builds a **classification model** that predicts the probability of a customer leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Features & Highlights

- Cleaned & preprocessed customer data  
- Encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder`  
- Addressed **class imbalance** with **SMOTE**  
- Built and tuned **XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression** models  
- Used **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization  
- Achieved high **ROC AUC Score & Recall**  
- Fully deployed **interactive Streamlit web app** for real-time prediction
